# Rust toolchain configuration for Nova Staking
# ==============================================
# This pins the Rust version for compatibility with Solana SBF toolchain.
#
# Solana 1.18.x uses rustc 1.75.0-dev internally for SBF compilation.
# However, the host toolchain needs to be compatible with Anchor 0.29.0
# and should support generating a valid Cargo.lock.
#
# IMPORTANT: The actual SBF compilation uses Solana's bundled SBF toolchain,
# not this host toolchain. This toolchain is used for:
# - Running `cargo update` to generate Cargo.lock
# - Running `anchor build` which orchestrates the SBF build
# - Running tests
#
# Compatible toolchain: 1.79.0 (tested with Anchor 0.29.0 + Solana 1.18.x)
# 
# If you encounter edition2024 errors, ensure the patches in Cargo.toml
# are correctly pinning blake3 to v1.5.5 (not v1.8.3+).
