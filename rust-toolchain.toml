# Rust toolchain configuration for Nova Staking
# ==============================================
# This pins the Rust version for compatibility with Solana SBF toolchain.
# Solana 1.18.x uses rustc 1.75.0-dev internally for SBF compilation.
#
# Note: The host toolchain (this file) is used for cargo operations.
# The actual SBF compilation uses Solana's bundled rustc 1.75.0-dev.
# We use stable 1.79.0 here as it's compatible with Anchor 0.29.0.
